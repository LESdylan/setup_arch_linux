## 1. The Problem

I'm running a **Born2beRoot** Debian VM inside VirtualBox with **NAT networking** and SSH on port 4242. I connect to it from VS Code using the **Remote - SSH** extension (`ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh`).

**The symptoms were always the same:**

- I'd connect fine with VS Code Remote SSH
- Everything works perfectly for ~15 minutes
- Then the connection silently dies
- VS Code shows: **"Connection timed out during banner exchange"**
- The log says: **"Running server is stale. Ignoring"**
- Every reconnect attempt fails with the same banner timeout
- But `ssh -p 4242 dlesieur@127.0.0.1` from a regular terminal **still works fine**

The last point was the key clue — SSH itself was fine. The problem was specific to VS Code.

Here's what the VS Code Remote SSH log looked like every time it died:

```
[15:12:24] SSH Resolver called for "ssh-remote+...", attempt 1
[15:12:24] Found local server running: {..., "socksPort": 49526, ...}
[15:12:24] Found running server - short-circuiting install
[15:12:24] Starting forwarding server. local port 49534 -> socksPort 49526 -> remotePort 38065
...
[15:27:50] Running server is stale. Ignoring
[15:27:50] ssh: connect to host 127.0.0.1 port 4242: Connection timed out during banner exchange
```

Notice: it found a "running server" from a previous session, tried to reuse its SOCKS port, and then everything went sideways.

## 2. What I Tried First (And Why It Didn't Work)

I assumed it was an SSH problem and threw literally everything at it. Here's the full list of what I tried — **none of these fixed it by themselves**:

### Layer 1: SSH Keepalives (server side)
```bash
# In /etc/ssh/sshd_config on the VM:
ClientAliveInterval 30    # Server pings client every 30 seconds
ClientAliveCountMax 5     # 5 missed pings = disconnect
TCPKeepAlive yes          # Enable TCP-level keepalives
MaxStartups 50:30:100     # Accept many parallel connections (VS Code needs this)
MaxSessions 20            # Multiple sessions per connection
LoginGraceTime 300        # 5 min to authenticate (VS Code is slow to handshake)
```

### Layer 2: SSH Keepalives (client side, ~/.ssh/config)
```
Host *
    ServerAliveInterval 15    # Client pings server every 15 seconds
    ServerAliveCountMax 4     # 4 missed = disconnect
    TCPKeepAlive yes
```

### Layer 3: Kernel TCP Keepalives
```bash
# /etc/sysctl.d/99-ssh-keepalive.conf
net.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_time=60    # First probe after 60s (not default 7200!)
net.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_intvl=15   # Re-probe every 15s
net.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_probes=5   # 5 failed = dead
```

### Layer 4: NAT Keepalive Service
A systemd service that pings the VirtualBox NAT gateway every 30s to keep connection tracking alive:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
GW=$(ip route | awk '/default/ {print $3}' | head -1)
[ -z "$GW" ] && GW="10.0.2.2"
while true; do
    ping -c 1 -W 2 "$GW" >/dev/null 2>&1
    sleep 30
done
```

### Layer 5: SSHD Watchdog Service
A systemd service that checks if sshd is actually listening on port 4242 every 15s and restarts it if not:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
while true; do
    SSHD_ACTIVE=$(systemctl is-active ssh)
    LISTEN=$(ss -tlnp | grep -c 4242)
    if [ "$SSHD_ACTIVE" != "active" ] || [ "$LISTEN" = "0" ]; then
        systemctl restart ssh
    fi
    sleep 15
done
```

### Layer 6: systemd Auto-Restart Override
```ini
# /etc/systemd/system/ssh.service.d/override.conf
[Service]
Restart=always
RestartSec=3
StartLimitIntervalSec=60
StartLimitBurst=10
```

### Layer 7: tmux Auto-Attach
So at least terminal sessions survive the drops.

**Result: NONE OF THIS FIXED IT.** The connection STILL dropped every ~15 minutes. The SSH daemon was healthy, the keepalives were firing, the watchdog saw sshd as "active"... but VS Code's connection still died.

I was about to give up and rebuild the entire VM without LUKS encryption, thinking maybe that was causing it. That would have been the wrong move.

## 3. The Breakthrough — Finding the Real Cause

I found two critical GitHub issues on the `microsoft/vscode-remote-release` repo:

### Issue #1721 — `ssh -T timeouts with Remote - SSH`
**URL:** https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-remote-release/issues/1721

> **Key comment by a Microsoft engineer:**
> *"A general workaround for many of them is setting `"remote.SSH.useLocalServer": false`."*

Multiple people had the exact same symptoms. The fix that kept coming up:
- Delete `~/.config/Code` (or just the stale server cache)
- Set `remote.SSH.useLocalServer` to `false`

### Issue #10580 — SSH Connection Timeout after moving to a new location
**URL:** https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-remote-release/issues/10580

Same symptoms. VS Code SSH times out, but `ssh` from terminal works fine. The logs show the same pattern: "Found running server - short-circuiting install" → then it tries to reuse a stale SOCKS tunnel → dies.

### The Official Troubleshooting Wiki
**URL:** https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-remote-release/wiki/Remote-SSH-Troubleshooting

This page describes the two connection modes:

> **`remote.SSH.useLocalServer: true`** (default — "Local Server Mode"):  
> The Remote-SSH extension spawns an SSH process which will then be **reused by all VS Code windows** connected to that remote.
>
> **`remote.SSH.useLocalServer: false`** ("Terminal Mode"):  
> Each VS Code window has **its own** connection.

That was the moment I understood everything.

<a name="the-actual-root-cause"></a>
## 4. The Actual Root Cause Explained

Here's what's actually happening, step by step:

### VS Code's Default Connection Mode

When `remote.SSH.useLocalServer` is `true` (the default), VS Code does this:

```
ssh -v -T -D 49963 -o ConnectTimeout=15 dlesieur@127.0.0.1 -p 4242
              ^^
              THIS IS THE PROBLEM
```

That **`-D 49963`** flag creates a **SOCKS5 dynamic port forwarding proxy**. VS Code routes ALL its traffic (extensions, file access, terminals, debug sessions) through this single SOCKS tunnel. It's a smart optimization — one SSH connection serves everything.

### VirtualBox NAT Kills the SOCKS Tunnel

VirtualBox NAT has a **connection tracking table** that maps host ports to guest ports. This table has an **idle timeout** (somewhere around 5-15 minutes depending on the VirtualBox version). When there's no traffic on the SOCKS proxy for a while:

1. VirtualBox NAT silently drops the connection tracking entry
2. The SSH TCP connection stays "alive" (keepalives keep it going)
3. But the **SOCKS proxy DATA channels** inside the tunnel get corrupted/dropped
4. VS Code tries to send data through the SOCKS proxy → no response
5. VS Code marks the server as "stale"
6. VS Code tries to reconnect with a new SSH connection
7. But it still has **cached server data** from the old session (port numbers, process IDs, etc.)
8. It tries to reuse this stale data → **banner exchange timeout**

### Why Regular SSH Works Fine

Regular `ssh -p 4242 dlesieur@127.0.0.1` doesn't use `-D` (no SOCKS proxy). It's a simple TCP connection with keepalives. VirtualBox NAT handles simple TCP keepalives fine. The connection survives indefinitely.

### Why Keepalives Didn't Fix It

My keepalives were keeping the **SSH connection itself** alive. But the SOCKS proxy has its own data channels that go through different NAT connection tracking entries. The keepalives don't cover those.

### The Diagram

            NAT handles these fine
```

<a name="the-fix"></a>
## 5. The Fix — 3 Layers

### Layer A: VS Code Settings (THE critical fix)

```json
{
    "remote.SSH.useLocalServer": false,
    "remote.SSH.enableDynamicForwarding": false,
    "remote.SSH.useExecServer": false,
    "remote.SSH.connectTimeout": 60,
    "remote.SSH.showLoginTerminal": true
}
```

**What each setting does:**

| Setting | Value | Why |
|---------|-------|-----|
| `remote.SSH.useLocalServer` | `false` | **THE FIX.** Switches from "Local Server Mode" (shared SOCKS proxy) to "Terminal Mode" (each window gets its own SSH connection). No more shared tunnel to go stale. |
| `remote.SSH.enableDynamicForwarding` | `false` | Disables the `-D` SOCKS proxy flag entirely. VS Code uses direct TCP port forwarding instead, which VirtualBox NAT handles properly. |
| `remote.SSH.useExecServer` | `false` | Disables the exec server bootstrap. Less cached state = less "stale server" issues. Simpler connection lifecycle. |
| `remote.SSH.connectTimeout` | `60` | Give VS Code 60 seconds to connect (default is 15). On a busy VirtualBox host, the first connection can be slow. |
| `remote.SSH.showLoginTerminal` | `true` | Shows the SSH terminal during connection. Useful for debugging — I can see exactly what's happening if something goes wrong. |

### Layer B: Clean Stale Server Cache

```bash
# On the HOST machine — clean VS Code's cached server data
rm -rf ~/.config/Code/User/globalStorage/ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh/vscode-ssh-host-*
```

This removes the stale "Found running server" data that causes VS Code to try to reuse dead SOCKS tunnels.

### Layer C: SSH Key Authentication (no more password prompts)

Without key auth, every time VS Code reconnects it needs a password. If the connection drops and tries to auto-reconnect, it can't type the password → permanent failure.

With key auth:
- Connection drops
- VS Code automatically reconnects
- No password needed → instant reconnect
- You don't even notice the drop

```bash
# On the HOST — copy your public key to the VM
ssh-copy-id -p 4242 dlesieur@127.0.0.1

# Verify it works (should NOT ask for password)
ssh -o BatchMode=yes -p 4242 dlesieur@127.0.0.1 echo "KEY AUTH WORKS"
```

## 6. VS Code settings.json — Exact Configuration

File location: `~/.config/Code/User/settings.json`

Here's my complete settings.json with the Remote SSH fixes:

```json
{
    "inlineChat.hideOnRequest": true,
    "workbench.colorTheme": "GitHub Dark High Contrast",
    "editor.dragAndDrop": false,
    "editor.definitionLinkOpensInPeek": true,
    "editor.insertSpaces": false,
    "files.autoSave": "afterDelay",
    "github.copilot.nextEditSuggestions.enabled": true,
    "github.copilot.enable": {
        "*": true,
        "plaintext": false,
        "markdown": true,
        "scminput": false,
        "c": false
    },
    "explorer.confirmDelete": false,
    "makefile.configureOnOpen": true,
    "explorer.confirmDragAndDrop": false,
    "remote.SSH.useLocalServer": false,
    "remote.SSH.enableDynamicForwarding": false,
    "remote.SSH.useExecServer": false,
    "remote.SSH.connectTimeout": 60,
    "remote.SSH.showLoginTerminal": true,
    "remote.SSH.remotePlatform": {
        "b2b": "linux"
    }
}
```

### How to apply manually

1. Open VS Code
2. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` → type "Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)"
3. Add the `remote.SSH.*` lines from above
4. Save
5. Reload VS Code (`Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Developer: Reload Window")

### Or from the terminal:

```bash
# Using python3 to safely merge into existing settings
python3 -c "
import json
settings_path = '$HOME/.config/Code/User/settings.json'
with open(settings_path, 'r') as f:
    s = json.load(f)
s['remote.SSH.useLocalServer'] = False
s['remote.SSH.enableDynamicForwarding'] = False
s['remote.SSH.useExecServer'] = False
s['remote.SSH.connectTimeout'] = 60
s['remote.SSH.showLoginTerminal'] = True
with open(settings_path, 'w') as f:
    json.dump(s, f, indent=4)
print('Done')
"
```

## 7. SSH Config — Host Side (~/.ssh/config)

File location: `~/.ssh/config`

```
Host *
    ServerAliveInterval 15
    ServerAliveCountMax 4
    TCPKeepAlive yes
    ConnectionAttempts 3
    ConnectTimeout 15

# Born2beRoot VM (auto-generated by orchestrate.sh)
Host b2b vm born2beroot
    HostName 127.0.0.1
    Port 4242
    User dlesieur
    ServerAliveInterval 15
    ServerAliveCountMax 6
    TCPKeepAlive yes
    ConnectionAttempts 5
    ConnectTimeout 15
    StrictHostKeyChecking no
    UserKnownHostsFile /dev/null
    LogLevel ERROR
```

### What each line does:

| Line | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `ServerAliveInterval 15` | Client sends a keepalive to the server every 15 seconds. This keeps VirtualBox NAT from thinking the connection is idle. |
| `ServerAliveCountMax 6` | If 6 keepalives get no response (= 90 seconds), consider the connection dead. |
| `TCPKeepAlive yes` | Also enable OS-level TCP keepalives (belt AND suspenders). |
| `ConnectionAttempts 5` | Try 5 times if the initial TCP connection fails. |
| `ConnectTimeout 15` | Wait up to 15 seconds for the TCP connection to establish. |
| `StrictHostKeyChecking no` | Don't ask "are you sure you want to connect?" every time (the VM regenerates its host key on rebuild). |
| `UserKnownHostsFile /dev/null` | Don't save the VM's host key (it changes on every `make re`). |
| `LogLevel ERROR` | Don't spam warnings about the unknown host key. |

### Why `Host b2b vm born2beroot` (space-separated)?

This creates three aliases for the same host. I can use any of these:
```bash
ssh b2b            # shortest
ssh vm             # also works
ssh born2beroot    # full name
```

And in VS Code, I connect to `b2b` as the remote host.

<a name="ssh-config-vm"></a>
## 8. SSH Config — VM Side (/etc/ssh/sshd_config)

These settings are applied by `preseeds/b2b-setup.sh` during VM installation:

```bash
Port 4242                      # Born2beRoot requires non-standard port
PermitRootLogin no             # Born2beRoot security requirement
PasswordAuthentication yes     # Allow password auth (for initial setup)
PubkeyAuthentication yes       # Also allow key auth (for VS Code)
ClientAliveInterval 30         # Server pings client every 30s
ClientAliveCountMax 5          # 5 missed = kill the session
TCPKeepAlive yes               # OS-level keepalives too
MaxStartups 50:30:100          # VS Code opens MANY parallel connections
MaxSessions 20                 # Allow multiple sessions per connection
LoginGraceTime 300             # 5 min to complete auth (VS Code is slow)
```

### Why MaxStartups 50:30:100?

This was a hard-won lesson. VS Code Remote SSH opens **many** parallel SSH connections simultaneously when it connects:

- 1 for the SOCKS/control channel
- 1 for the exec server
- 1-2 for the extension host
- 1 per terminal
- 1 for file operations
- More for port forwarding

The default `MaxStartups 10:30:100` starts randomly rejecting connections at 10 unauthenticated. VS Code sometimes needs 15+ simultaneous new connections on reconnect. At 50, it has plenty of room.

### Kernel TCP Keepalives

```bash
# /etc/sysctl.d/99-ssh-keepalive.conf
net.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_time=60     # First probe after 60s idle
net.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_intvl=15    # Re-probe every 15s
net.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_probes=5    # 5 failed probes = dead
```

The Linux default `tcp_keepalive_time` is **7200 seconds (2 hours!)** — way too long for VirtualBox NAT which drops idle connections in ~5-15 minutes.

<a name="make-re-automation"></a>
## 10. How It's All Baked Into `make re`

All of this is automated so I never have to do it manually again. When I run `make re`:

### 1. ISO Creation (`generate/create_custom_iso.sh`)
- Copies `b2b-setup.sh`, `monitoring.sh`, `first-boot-setup.sh` into the ISO
- **NEW:** Also copies my host's SSH public key as `host_ssh_pubkey` into the ISO

### 2. VM Installation (preseed + `b2b-setup.sh`)
- Preseed automates the entire Debian installation
- `b2b-setup.sh` runs in chroot and configures:
  - SSH on port 4242 with all keepalive settings
  - MaxStartups 50:30:100 for VS Code
  - NAT keepalive systemd service
  - SSHD watchdog systemd service
  - Kernel TCP keepalive sysctl
  - systemd auto-restart override for sshd
  - **NEW:** Installs host SSH public key from ISO into `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`
  - **NEW:** Enables `PubkeyAuthentication yes`

### 3. Orchestrator (`generate/orchestrate.sh`)
After the ISO is built and VM is created:
- `setup_host_ssh_config()` — writes `~/.ssh/config` with keepalive settings and `b2b` alias
- **NEW:** `setup_vscode_remote_ssh()` — auto-configures VS Code `settings.json` with the 5 critical Remote SSH settings
- **NEW:** `setup_ssh_key_auth()` — generates SSH key pair if none exists

### The result
After `make re`, I can immediately do:
1. Boot the VM
2. Enter LUKS passphrase (tempencrypt123)
3. Open VS Code → Remote SSH → Connect to `b2b`
4. **No password prompt** (key auth)
5. **Connection never drops** (Terminal Mode, no SOCKS proxy)

## 11. Sources & References

### Primary Sources (these solved my problem)

| Source | What I learned |
|--------|---------------|
| [GitHub Issue #1721 — ssh -T timeouts with Remote - SSH](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-remote-release/issues/1721) | Microsoft engineer's comment: *"A general workaround for many of them is setting `remote.SSH.useLocalServer: false`"*. Multiple users confirmed that cleaning `~/.config/Code` + setting this fixed their identical symptoms. |
| [GitHub Issue #10580 — SSH Connection Timeout after moving](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-remote-release/issues/10580) | User had the exact same symptoms with a VM. SSH works from terminal, dies in VS Code. The log showed the same "Found running server / stale / banner timeout" pattern I was seeing. |
| [VS Code Remote SSH Troubleshooting Wiki](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-remote-release/wiki/Remote-SSH-Troubleshooting) | Official documentation explaining Local Server Mode vs Terminal Mode. Describes `useLocalServer`, `useExecServer`, `enableDynamicForwarding` and their effects. |

### Supporting Knowledge

| Topic | Resource |
|-------|----------|
| VirtualBox NAT connection tracking | VirtualBox docs — NAT engine maintains a connection tracking table with idle timeouts. No official documentation of the exact timeout value. |
| SSH SOCKS proxy (`-D` flag) | `man ssh` — "Specifies a local dynamic application-level port forwarding". Creates a SOCKS5 proxy through the SSH tunnel. |
| OpenSSH keepalives | `man sshd_config` — `ClientAliveInterval`, `ClientAliveCountMax`. These operate at the SSH protocol level, not TCP. |
| TCP keepalives | Linux kernel docs — `tcp_keepalive_time`, `tcp_keepalive_intvl`, `tcp_keepalive_probes`. These operate at the TCP level. |
| MaxStartups | `man sshd_config` — "Specifies the maximum number of concurrent unauthenticated connections to the SSH daemon. start:rate:full format." |

### What DIDN'T help (but is commonly suggested)

| Suggestion | Why it didn't work for me |
|------------|--------------------------|
| "Increase keepalive intervals" | Keepalives protect the SSH connection, not the SOCKS proxy data channels inside it. |
| "Remove LUKS encryption" | LUKS is transparent after boot — it has zero effect on networking. |
| "Use bridged networking instead of NAT" | Would work but isn't necessary — the real fix is in VS Code settings. Also, 42 campus networks often block bridged VMs. |
| "Restart sshd" | The sshd was never the problem — it was always running and healthy. |
| "Increase VM RAM" | Memory wasn't the issue — the VM had plenty. |

## TL;DR

**The problem was never SSH. It was VS Code.**

VS Code Remote SSH defaults to `"remote.SSH.useLocalServer": true`, which creates a **shared SOCKS5 proxy** (`ssh -D port`). VirtualBox NAT silently drops the SOCKS proxy state after ~15 minutes idle. VS Code then tries to reuse stale cached server data, and everything dies.

**The fix is 3 settings:**

```json
{
    "remote.SSH.useLocalServer": false,
    "remote.SSH.enableDynamicForwarding": false,
    "remote.SSH.useExecServer": false
}
```

Plus SSH key auth so reconnects are instant and automatic. That's it. 12 hours of debugging for 3 lines of JSON. 🫠
