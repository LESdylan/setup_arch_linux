            <h2>Step 5: Configure the Bootloader</h2>
            <p>After installation, you may need to configure the bootloader to allow you to choose between the two operating systems at startup. This can usually be done through the installation process of the second OS.</p>

            <h2>Step 6: Finalize and Personalize</h2>
            <p>Once both operating systems are installed, you can personalize each environment according to your preferences. Don't forget to check security settings for both systems.</p>
